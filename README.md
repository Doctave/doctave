The DoctaveCLI is an opinionated documentation site generator that converts your Markdown files into
a beautiful developer hub with minimal effort.

The Doctave CLI is not a generic static site generator - it is only meant for generating
documentation sites from Markdown. This allows the tool to be much simpler than other solutions,
with fewer configuration steps.

This open source CLI is built and maintained by [Doctave](https://www.doctave.com).

## Features

Doctave comes with a number of documentation-specific features out of the box. No plugins needed.

- [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) diagrams
- Full-text search
- Local live-reloading server
- Minimal configuration
- GitHub flavored markdown
- Fast build times, built in Rust
