Doctave CLI
===========

The [Doctave](https://www.doctave.com) CLI is an opinionated documentation site generator that
converts your Markdown files into a beautiful developer hub.

The Doctave CLI is not a generic static site generator - it is only meant for generating
documentation sites from Markdown. This allows the tool to be much simpler than other solutions,
with fewer configuration steps.

This open source CLI is built and maintained by [Doctave](https://www.doctave.com). While it is
meant originally to be used for projects that are hosted on Doctave.com, it does not depend on it,
and you are free to deploy the generated sites as you please. _This CLI is and always will be free
and open source._

You can read more about hosting your docs on Doctave [here](https://www.doctave.com).
