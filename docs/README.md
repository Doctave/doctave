Doctave CLI
===========

The Doctave CLI is an opinionated documentation site generator that converts your Markdown files
into a beautiful developer documentation site.

It is not a generic static site generator - it is only meant for generating documentation sites from
Markdown. This allows the tool to be much simpler than other solutions, and requires little to no
configuration. You just start documenting.

Doctave is written in Rust and is distributed as a single self-contained binary. It has no
dependencies, and works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.

This open source CLI is built and maintained by [Doctave](https://www.doctave.com).
